\*\*Defaultable Generator\*\* is the build-time dependency that does the heavy lifting for the `defaultable` package. It contains the code generation logic, responsible for creating the `.fromDefaults()` factory constructors and the global `getInstance()` factory for your data classes.



This package is a \*\*`dev\_dependency`\*\* and is not used in your final application. It is only required during development to generate the Dart code files.



-----



\## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation



To use `defaultable\_generator`, you need to add it and `build\_runner` to your `dev\_dependencies` in your `pubspec.yaml` file.



```yaml

dev\_dependencies:

&nbsp; build\_runner: ^2.4.0

&nbsp; defaultable\_generator: ^0.1.0 # Or the latest version

```



You must also include the `defaultable` package in your regular dependencies.



```yaml

dependencies:

&nbsp; defaultable: ^0.1.0 # Or the latest version

```



-----



\## üöÄ Usage



This package is designed to be used via the `dart run build\_runner build` command. You do not need to interact with its classes or functions directly.



The generator looks for two key annotations provided by the `defaultable` package:



1\.  \*\*`@Defaultable()`\*\*: This annotation on a class triggers the generator to create the `\_$classNameFromDefaults()` function and the `\*.defaultable.g.dart` part file.



2\.  \*\*`@defaultableRegistry`\*\*: This annotation on a top-level element (like a class or a constant) triggers the generator to create a global `getInstance()` factory in the corresponding part file.



After setting up your classes with these annotations, you simply run the following command in your terminal from the root of your project:



```bash

dart run build\_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

```



The generator will automatically scan your project, find the annotated classes, and produce the necessary `.g.dart` files.

\## üöß Configuration



While `defaultable\_generator` works out-of-the-box for most use cases, you can configure its behavior via a `build.yaml` file in the root of your project.



For example, you can adjust the output path or other options. Refer to the `build\_runner` documentation for more details on advanced configuration.
